Smart Support & Resistance Zones – Usage Guide

This indicator automatically detects support and resistance zones using pivot closes and wick boundaries. It updates dynamically and extends zones into future bars for better price reaction analysis.

How to Use (Recommended Strategy)

Open a higher timeframe (Daily or H4) and let the indicator draw the main key zones.

Move to a lower timeframe (H1 or M30) and wait for price to return to one of the higher-TF zones.

Enter only after price action confirmation such as:

Engulfing candle

Pin bar / Rejection

Break of structure (BOS) or CHoCH

Set stop loss outside the zone wick and target minimum 1:2 RRR.

Notes

Use with trend filters and confluence for higher accuracy.

Backtest before live trading.
